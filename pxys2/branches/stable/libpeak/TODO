Highest priority:
- Write example programs
- Handle system clock change
- Improve thread safety where it's not finished, in some peak objects, like
  in timers.

Lower priority:
- Fix prebinding on Mac OS X (for more efficient mach-o dynamic library)
- Fix shared library build on cygwin (if possible?)

General:
- Add more architecture dependent code ( see peak/arch/ )
- Create more peak/db lightweight containers (idea: array, set, tree, ...)

Socket streams:
- Add SSL support for realtime encryption
- Add zlib support for realtime compression

Send suggestions to mbuna@bugged.org, thanks!
