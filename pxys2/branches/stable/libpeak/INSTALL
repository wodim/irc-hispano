      PEAK Library :: Parallel Events and Asynchronous tasKing Library
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION
============

The PEAK Library is easy to install on systems where it's
supported. On most systems, GNU CC (gcc) is recommended to compile
libpeak. However, on some architectures like POWER or PPC970, gcc
still lacks some optimization support. We will then try to allow you
to compile libpeak on such systems. Please note that it's low priority
unless someone requests it; see the sourceforge.net project page for
that: http://sourceforge.net/projects/peak.

CONFIGURING COMPILATION
=======================

To install in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include/peak:

   ./configure

or to install in /usr/lib and /usr/include/peak:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr

or similarly to install in your home directory (another example..):

   ./configure --prefix=$HOME

If you plan to use libpeak on a uniprocessor machine *ONLY*, you can
turn off possible SMP code overhead by adding this configure option:

   --enable-uniprocessor-only

At the end of the configure script, you will see a summary of the main
options (installation paths, detected architecture, multiplexing
engine used...). At this time you might want to force the use of
another engine by adding this configure option (example to choose epoll):

   --with-engine=epoll

Obviously your system must support the choosen engine.


COMPILING
=========

Then, to compile the library (default is to build a shared and static
version, if possible):

   make

Optionally, you can compile and run the test suite to verify libpeak's
working correctly:

   make check


INSTALLING
==========

Finally, you want to install it with:

make install

This will copy the libraries and its headers at the good
places. Additionally, a little script named peak-config will be
installed which allow programs using libpeak to detect it. The
peak-config script should be in a place defined in your PATH
environment variable.

Please report installation problems to mbuna@bugged.org.
