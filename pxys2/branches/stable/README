(*) = Third party library where only configuration scripts may differ from
      the original source.


ipcache
-------
Source code of a LRU IP cache model, which is used in both daemons (pxyscand
and pxyservd). It's not a library but more a template to instantiate directly
in each program. A quick check of the defines in ipcache_template.c will show
you why it's like that. pxyservd only uses it as a little "level 1" cache but
pxyscand make heavy usage of it to store last recently used proxy and non
proxy IPs. It's used in conjonction of libpeak in both programs to improve
memory allocation and time stuffs.

libopas
-------
The OPAS Library helps communications between pxyscand and pxyservd. It
implements the OPAS (binary) protocol as defined in libopas/draft-opas-1.txt.
It's based on a simple query/reply concept and is able to encapsulate user
defined messages, thus the transport channel can be used for several purposes.

pxyscand
--------
Our proxy scanner daemon. The only code in C++ here, I guess. It implements
an OPAS server to communicate with OPAS clients (like pxyservd). There is
a base class (PXScanModule) to overload when you write a new scan type, check
out the existing scan modules like PXMHttpProxy.cc, it's not hard to add new
type of scan!

pxyservd
--------
IRCU (Undernet ircd) service server daemon. Compatible with ircu2.10.10+,
it's an interface between the IRC network and pxyscand. It creates a server
which links to the network. It communicates with pxyscand to check the users
and glines the proxies. It has a logging system with a daily rotation that
your abuse team will enjoy. It uses Kevin L Mitchell dbprim library. This
library offers a very efficient (for CPU and memory) and convenient way to
work especially with linked lists, hash tables and sparse matrix, which are
used a lot in such a service.
Additionally, pxyservd creates a virtual client on the network, which acts
like an interface between coders/opers and the daemon. We can say it's an
oper service, however it's willingly limited to proxy related and statisticals
stuffs. If you want a complete IRCU services suite, try GNUWorld at
http://gnuworld.sf.net.

pxtarget
--------
pxtarget - A daemon answering to forwarded (from open proxies) queries and
           replying with a sha256 hash. (based on a shared secret + a
           timestamp).
pscheck -  Command line tool to verify a pxtarget daemon is running
           correctly.
