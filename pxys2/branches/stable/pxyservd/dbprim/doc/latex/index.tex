This library contains a set of database primitives. The primitives defined by this library include a powerful linked list abstraction, a hash table with optional automatic resizing, a powerful and efficient sparse matrix implementation, and a red-black tree with iterative traversals. All of the necessary declarations for using this library are found in the header file \hyperlink{dbprim_8h}{dbprim.h}. For more information about the components of this library, see the module list.
