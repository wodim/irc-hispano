  <!-- pxyscand uses a lightweight binary protocol (currently only implemented
       over TCP) called the OPAS protocol. Protocol's draft is located in
       pxys2/libopas/doc/draft-opas-1.txt.
       
       port: the port to listen to
       bind-address: source address of the listener (empty for default)
       protocol: only tcp for now
       allow: can be defined several times, it defines an IP to allow
       requests from.
       limit: not implemented yet

  <!-- The scanner tag defines very important settings of your proxy scanner:
       
       maxscans: number of max socket to open for scanning - the more you have,
       the more you can scan at the same time. I use a value > 10000 on the
       Undernet. Be careful, you often need to do some system's tunning to
       increase this value (using sysctl for example on BSD systems...).
       The total number of simultaneous IPs you can scan is
       maxscans/number_of_modules_enabled.
       4000 is already a very big value; a good way to do it is to try a low
       value and see: if the scanning activity stays at 100% (use the
       "/msg prox status -scan" command) then increase it.
       
       module: see, it's easy to add other http proxy ports, or to comment
       a type of scan... Note that the wingate module contains the insecure
       Cisco detection (2 in 1 scan).
       
       source-pool, optional tag: 1 or more source IPs to scan from ("vhosts").
       An uniform random shuffle is done by the scanner to fool firewalls.
       
       target, for some scans like socks4 scanning, because the proxy doesn't
       reply a proper error or status flag, we need to be sure the socks has
       really connected to something (eg. an IRC server). IMPORTANT: so please
       maintain an up-to-date list of one or a few targets (i recommend the
       more stable servers of your IRC network). If the scanner has no more
       target IP up, it can't scan!
       
       target-check: pxyscand performs a simple connect check on the current
       target IP, to verify it's still up. If not, it trys the next one.
       target-check is a delay in seconds of these checks' frequency.
       
       log-agent: relative or (prefered) full path of http agents logging, for
       stats purpose, it's fun.
       
       timeout: connect() timeout in seconds. Important setting. If your
       scanner get lagged, increase this value as some proxies might not be
       found.
       
       string: a string to match when connecting to a target host via a proxy,
       used to detect a real proxy connection, and thus to detect the proxy.
       You can define several matching strings.

       directory: a (prefered) full path of the directory where the cache
       files should be stored. The directory must exist.
       
       expire: expire duration in seconds for non-proxy IPs, should probably
       be at least 1 day to not annoy too much.
       
       proxy-expire: expire duration in seconds of a proxy IP found. Please,
       don't set a too high expiration duration here, some users fix their
       proxy in a few hours, or sometimes it can be accidental, etc.
       
       maxips: max number of IPs of the noproxy IP cache. A prime number
       increases performance.
