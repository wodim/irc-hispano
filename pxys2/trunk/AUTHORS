* Conceived and written for the Undernet Coder-Com by:

  Stephane Thiell (mbuna) <mbuna@undernet.org>
    Student in Computer Science at the University of Bordeaux I, France.
    My speciality is "distribued systems, parallelism and networking". You
    know, I play with Myrinet clusters, other parallel machines, MPI,
    Java RMI, Corba and stuffs. :)
    Note the pxys project is not related to my studies. I might have other
    open source projects, please check http://www.bugged.org.
    Pxys v2 along with libpeak are developed on Mac OS X 10.3 / Darwin 7
    (which have kqueue) and FreeBSD 5.1. I mainly use GNU emacs running on
    Apple's x11 (all source files should fit well on a 80 columns width frame).

* Ideas and advices

  Thanks to Jeb <jeb@jeb.com.fr> for his efficient beta testing, ideas and his cool
  userload/channels simulators written in perl!

  Thanks to Kev for his great dbprim library, something not very entertaining
  to write but so useful after in programs.

  Some extracts of ircu have been used here. Thanks to Nemesi, Run, Isomer,
  Jeekay, netski, pomac and all Undernet's coder-com for some parts (match.c,
