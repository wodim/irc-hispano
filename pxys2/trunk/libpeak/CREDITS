All concepts in libpeak are not mine. The experimental parallel events
handling part is. Libpeak uses now well known concepts for
asynchronous I/O events which can be found in several open source
"event libraries". The runtime system is inspired from the open source
Mac OS X CoreFoundation framework, but it's lighter in libpeak. The
few assembly parts are taken from FreeBSD and Linux kernel source and
from the PM2 software suite. They are only tuned a bit to fit in
libpeak. I'm sorry if I forgot something here. I'm glad if libpeak
might help for other projects too.

Now some people who've put work into libpeak:

Jean-Edouard Babin, author of the Perl script for the test suite. Also
an excellent tester, especially on NetBSD and rare funky systems!

Philippe Bourcier for his encouragements and ideas in several areas
(possible applications for libpeak, benchmarking, etc).

Pascal Gloor for his encouragements, advises and patches.

Technical support is indispensable when developing a library like the
PEAK Library. Thanks go to Jean-Edouard Babin (PPC970), Philippe
Sainte-Marie (Linux x86 2.6.1), Kevin Roettger (Yellow Dog Linux PPC
2.4, 2.6), Julien B. (Linux slackware, HP/UX), Nicolas Goy (Solaris
2.9) and the University of Bordeaux I, France (AIX, older Solaris,
Linux 2.4 SMP, Alpha, etc.) for providing the needed support.
