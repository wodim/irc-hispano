\subsection{Detailed Description}
In the PEAK library, a task is an abstract object that is eventually made of several threads to process asynchronous events... It's a bit like a micro process. Then when you schedule a task for a stream for example, it will takes the advantage (or the disadvantage) of having several threads available to process events.
