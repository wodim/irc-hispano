Parallel Events and Asynchronous tas\-King Library

\begin{Desc}
\item[]This library implements an environnement suitable for event-based application and provides support for necessary multi-threading. With libpeak, it is possible to process events in parallel. It might bring gain on SMP computers. However, try to bring kernel threads overhead to its minimum, so it shouldn't be used on mono-processor machine, unless your application needs to do, for example, lots of I/O operations that aren't handled by the library, along with other calculation.\end{Desc}
\begin{Desc}
\item[]But the peak library is more than that. It provides a set of modules for efficient coding in an event-based environment and even extra modules which can be found useful on classic applications too.\end{Desc}
