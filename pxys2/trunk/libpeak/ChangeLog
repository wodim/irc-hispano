2007-03-06  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* Main for-loop for epoll_wait was wrong
	  Submitted by Pascal Gloor <pascal.gloor@spale.com>

2005-02-28  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* Fixed a bug when the last timer is removed
	* Changed engine private-extern function names

2004-01-18  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* Release of libpeak 0.1.0 (first public release).
	* configure.ac: Fixed NetBSD compilation.
	* CREDITS: New file with some info and credits.
	* INSTALL: New file with some info about libpeak's installation.
	* README.platforms: New file with some advices and info about
	currently supported platforms.

2004-01-17  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* peak/engine_mod_devpoll.c: Fixed a bug when registering
	signals in the engine (clients array wasn't allocated...), also
	when we want to remove a signal.
	* peak/arch/sparc: Added support for sparc processors. Tested a
	bit on sparc-sun-solaris2.6, 2.8 and 2.9.

2004-01-12  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* peak/timer.c, peak/task.c: Fixed a bug when reconfiguring a
	timer.
	* peak/semaphore.h: Fixed header includes to avoid a warning on
	FreeBSD 4.5.

2004-01-10  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* peak/task.c: Fixed a bug in __peak_task_timer_insert() when
	updating task->_tifirst.
	* peak/stream.c: Internal timer bug fix, following the changes in
	peak/task.c.
	* peak/task.h: Improved documentation for peak_task_timer_add()
	and peak_task_timer_remove().
	* peak/task.c: Fixed peak_task_timer_remove(): for convenience, it
	does nothing if the timer is not added to the task. Missing code
	in peak_task_timer_add() and remove() so that they respectively
	retain and release the timer.

2004-01-09  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* peak/engine_mod_poll.c, peak/engine_mod_kqueue.c: Fixed code
	when removing handled signals.
	* tests/t_atomic1.c, tests/t_atomic2.c, tests/t_signal2.c: New
	tests.
	* peak/engine_mod_epoll.c: Fix bug (signal issue). Tested on
	Linux 2.6.1.

2004-01-08  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* tests/t_timer3.c: Modified threaded test program to use
	peak_atomic_dec(). Increased timeout delay too.
	* configure.ac, peak/peak.h: Added peak/atomic.h
	auto-generation. Added the peak_atomic's primitives to the API.
	* peak/engine_mod_epoll.c: Added new epoll() task's underlying
	engine (available on Linux 2.6).
	* peak/errors.c: Removed use of strerror_r() as it's broken
	on some Linux systems (glibc)...
	* peak/signal.h: Added documentation for peak_signal objects.
	Rebuilt docs.
	* configure.ac, peak/*: Fixed some 64-bit portability warnings
	on AIX.

2004-01-07  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* peak/semaphore.h, peak/arch/powerpc/spinlock.h: Fixed things
	to make libpeak compile on Linux PPC (YDL 3.0).
	* configure.ac, peak/Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.am,
	peak/arch/powerpc/atomic.h peak/arch/powerpc/spinlock.h: Added
	AIX support. Not tested with AIX < 5.

2004-01-06  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* acinclude.m4, tz.c: Added better struct tzhead availability. 
	* peak/task.c, peak/timer_tree.c: Changed internal task's pending
	timers management from a linked list to an ordered splay tree
	(featuring a special "first access" in O(1)). Now instead of
	O(1)/O(n)/O(n) we have O(1)/O(log(N))/O(log(N)) for first
	accessor/any add/any remove complexity. And in practice, timers
	insertions and removals are often in constant time.

2004-01-05  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* tests: Added timer tests; more tests to come...
	* peak/task.c peak/timer.c: code cleaning for timers

2004-01-04  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* peak/task.c: Added TASK_FLAG_RUNNING to avoid setting
	TASK_FLAG_ON_TIME when it's not running.
	* doc: rebuilt docs
	* peak/timer.h, peak/timer.c: Added peak_timer_set_context()
	* tests: New tests directory
	* tests/test-suite.pl:  New test suite script (to do)
	* tests/t_timer1.c: New little timer test program
	* Enabled make check to compile and run the (future) test suite.

2004-01-03  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* peak/time.c: Fixed a bad array subscript type 

2004-01-02  Stephane Thiell  <mbuna@bugged.org>

	* peak/arch/test/spinlocktest.c: Added this little spinlock test
	program. Improved a bit the atomic test program and added an
	option to enable normal code instead of atomic one (to see that's
	the program fails).
	* peak/arch/m68k: Added support for m68k (probably only 68020+),
	assembly code only tested on m68k-unknown-netbsdelf1.6ZC.
	* peak/stream.c: Removed fatal error from
	__peak_stream_send_queued() and peak_stream_write_buffered(), as
	asynchronous errors can happen there. For now, ignore any errors,
	it should be handled by the engine at the next event loop.

	* Sourceforge.net import
