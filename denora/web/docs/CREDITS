The engine used to generate the real-time graphs is jpGraph and is
integrated in this phpDenora distribution

Big thanks to all language file contributors, which make phpDenora
useable by a wider range of people.

Special thanks also go to all the people from the Denora IRC channel
and Forums, and to those using the bug tracker for testing, reporting
problems, and making suggestions.
I couldn't keep improving phpDenora without you!
