Translating phpDenora into your language is an easy task:

1. Simply copy the lang/en/ directory and name it to your language,
   preferably using two letters. For example: lang/de/
2. Edit index.php and modify parameters accordignly
3. Edit lang.php and translate all the strings. For example,
   "DEFINE('_TM_NETWORK','Network');" would become
   "DEFINE('_TM_NETWORK','Rete');"
4. When you are done, zip your language directory up and send it to me and
   I will post it on the phpDenora web site and include it in the next release.

To upgrade your existing phpDenora 1.0.x-1.2.x language file, follow this procedure:

1. Read docs/Changes.lang to see which strings were added/modified/removed
2. Look at lang/en/lang.php for the original english translation
   and update your language file accordignly
3. Edit lang/yourlang/index.php and change the value of $lang_ver to '1.3.0'
4. When you are done, zip your language directory up and send it to me and
   I will post it on the phpDenora web site and include it in the next release.
