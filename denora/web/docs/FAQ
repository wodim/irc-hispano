phpDenora 1.4 Frequently Asked Questions
----------------------------------------

Q: phpDenora seems not to show any data
A: Check that phpDenora has proper access to the SQL database, check that
   your Denora installation is setup for SQL and running correctly.

Q: phpDenora does not show "Top 10 channels" and "Top 10 users" on front page
A: You need to assign the Denora bot to some channels to gather stats.
   Usually something like '/msg StatServ CHANSTATS ADD #channel'
   See the 'CHANSTATS ADD' command in the Denora documentation

Q: No MOTD is shown for my server
A: UnrealIRCd does not send the MOTD remotelly if it's named differently
   than ircd.motd. Just create a symlink named that way and restart Denora
   for changes to take effect.

Q: My Client Pie Graphs always show 100% unknown
A: Denora has the ctcp versioning on users disabled. Enable that feature,
   or disable the client pie graphs in the phpDenora configuration file.

Q: phpDenora seems not to track users correctly
A: This is an issue with Denora 1.1. The newest 1.4 releases (at the time
   of writing 1.4.3-RC1) have an improved nick tracking system. Due to the
   nature of Denora tracking all users connected it's impossible to
   guarantee perfect nick tracking. If users don't change their mask
   (username and provider) and/or provider they should be on the safe side.
   However you could enable the ustatsregistered option which then makes
   Denora track only registered +r users. We recommend you enable this.

Q: Some dates are displayed in English instead of my chosen language
A: The UTF-8 locale of the selected language must be installed on the
   system running phpDenora. Please consult your server administrator.

Q: Some dates are displayed with wrong or missing characters
A: The UTF-8 locale of the selected language must be installed on the
   system running phpDenora. Please consult your server administrator.
