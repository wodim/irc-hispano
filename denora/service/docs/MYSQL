Denora MySQL Support
-------------------

1) Introduction

    The MySQL support in Denora allows users to get real time statistics through
    SQL, for example via Web.
    We suggest you take a look at phpDenora (http://www.denorastats.org/).

2) Requirements

    1. MySQL server version 4.x or greater **
    2. MySQL libs and development files (usually called libmysql-dev or similar).
    3. A MySQL user account
    4. A MySQL database

3) Installation

    1. The ./Config script automatically detects if your system is capable
       of running Denora with MySQL support. There is no need anymore to
       answer yes when asked.

       Note: You might need to run "(g)make distclean" prior to running ./Config

    2. Compile Denora as usual. The (g)make process will now compile MySQL
       support into Denora.

    3. Install Denora as usual. 

4) Configuration

    1. Go to your "stats bin directory" (eg: /home/someuser/stats/) and run ./mydbgen 
       to help on the schema creation and adjustments.

    2. Edit denora.conf and add your MySQL data to the MySQL configuration
       block. 

    3. Start or restart services to make use of the new Denora executable.


** Note on older mysql such as 3.x are no longer fully supported it is recommended that
   you update to a more current version of mysql.
