          Statistics for IRC Networks

Denora is an open source, free software. However the developers have put a lot
of time, money and effort into making the program what it is today.

If you want to assist us or show your appreciation to the development team, use
the SourceForge linke below. You are not required to send anything and you can feel
free to ignore this. We're not asking for anything huge, whatever you can afford is fine.

Donation Link: <http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=137267>

If you don't want to use SourceForge to donate, contact as at dev@denorastats.org
before sending anything.

All donators will be listed on the website (regardless of the amount). To make 
this possible, please include along with your donation the name (or nickname) you want to 
appear in the list as well as the company name (or IRC server) to list. 

Thank you for your support,
The Denora Team
