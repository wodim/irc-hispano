eggdrop stats.mod -> denora chanstats converter [smconv.pl]
-----------------------------------------------
version 1.0.0 - <hal9000@denorastats.org>

INTRODUCTION
This converter, written in Perl, is intended to use for importing the database file
(usually 'statsmod.dat') of the popular stats.mod module for eggdrop bots.
The converter is non-destructive, in other words it will NOT overwrite any existing
data in your denora installation. Instead, it will smartly merge the data by summing
the various values with the existing ones, if existing.
So this converter works well both on new installs as well as on denora databases
which have been in use for some time.

REQUIREMENTS
As of the current version, the converter has been tested on Denora 1.0.1 build 370
with UnrealIRCd 3.2 database schema, stats.mod 1.3.3 database and MySQL 4.1.
The converter "should" work on any database scheme, and should work on any
stats.mod 1.3.x and 1.4.x databases as well (maybe earlier dbs too), but has
not been tested.

BEFORE CONVERTING
- Place smconv.pl into the directory where denora is installed and chmod +x
  if necessary.
- Copy your stats.mod file into the denora directory as well.
- Please note that the converter will have to shut down denora during upgrade.
  MAKE SURE YOU DISABLE ANY CRON CHECKS TO KEEP DENORA FROM STARTING UP DURING CONVERSION!

CONVERTING
Run ./smconv.pl and follow instructions on screen.
If you chose option 1 or 2, you will be asked three questions, asking wether to
convert monthly/weekly/daily stats. Just answer 'y' to all those questions, unless
you stopped using stats.mod yesterday or earlier.
For example, if you stopped using stats.mod at the end of last month,
and now the first week of the new month just started, you won't need to import
daily/weekly/monthly stats as they would refer to last month. Be careful on this
or you'll get a database with wrong data.

FEEDBACK
Contact the author for any feedback. Thank you.

CHANGELOG
v1.0.0 - 26.11.05
* support for fixing < 0.7.0 conversions removed
* updated author's email address
v0.7.0 - 02.07.05
* added support for updating ChannelStats.db and chan.db files as well
* removed some user prompts as they are not useful anymore (they were just for testing)
* this program now requires to be run in the denora directory
* denora is now stopped/started automatically
* sql output file is deleted after successful import
* sql database can be backed up before merge
* created startup menu for easilly chosing different operation modes
* some little cleanups
* moved release notes to the README file and wrote some instructions
v0.6.0 - 07.06.05
* fixed design flaw which would cause denora to segfault when trying to sumuser
  old users if daily, and/or weekly, and/or monthly stats were not imported
v0.5.0 - 07.06.05
* added support for converting user data, to allow sumuser before users join the net
  and denora becomes aware of them, and to prevent StatServ (harmless) error messages
  if users that are not in table join but stats already exist for them
v0.4.1 - 05.06.05
* removed feature introduced in v0.4.0 as it was useless: denora overwrites the chan
  table with data taken from chan.db, so i'll probably implement conversion for this later
* channel names and nicknames are now properly escaped to avoid potential sql problems
v0.4.0 - 04.06.05
* added support for max channel users for denora rev. 315+
v0.3.0 - 04.06.05
* dumped the mysql/dbi module usage in favor of a simpler and more compatible system command
* wooops! fixed sql query typo in daily, weekly and monthly stats
* removed useless (but harmless) ` from some sql queries
v0.2.0 - 04.06.05
* added some user interactivity
* added dbi mysql support
v0.1.0 - 04.06.05
* added support for daily, weekly and monthly stats
v0.0.0 - 04.06.05
